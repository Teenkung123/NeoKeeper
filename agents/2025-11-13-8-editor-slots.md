# Station editor slots (attempt 8)

- Config (`src/main/resources/config.yml` and `bin/main/config.yml`) now exposes `MaterialSlots` and `ResultSlot` under `Station.Editor.Recipe`, matching the runtime changes made earlier.
- No code changes were needed this round beyond mirroring the config update.
- Still unable to run Gradle locally (missing wrapper); please rebuild in your environment.
