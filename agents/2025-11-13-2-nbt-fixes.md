# Station compile fixes

- Fixed ambiguous `NBT.modify` calls across all station GUIs by explicitly casting the lambda to a `Consumer<ReadWriteItemNBT>` so the compiler selects the desired overload.
- Fixed ambiguous `NBT.get` calls in `StationGUIHandler` by casting to `Function<ReadableItemNBT, T>` and adding null guards.
- Reworked the excellent crates branch in `ConfigItemBuilder` to use the modern multi-label switch (`case "EC", "EC_KEY" ->`) so Java 17 accepts the switch expression.
- Re-built `bin/main/config.yml` and ensured station resources continue to mirror the source tree.
- Build not re-run locally because the Gradle wrapper is absent in this workspace (same limitation as previous run).
